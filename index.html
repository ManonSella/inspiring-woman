      <p class="biography">
        Mylène Jeanne Gautier, born on the 12th of September 1961, known
        professionally as Mylène Farmer, is a French singer and songwriter.
        Having sold more than 30 million records worldwide, she is among the
        most successful recording artists of all time in France, where she holds
        the record for the most number one hit singles, with twenty-one - eight
        of which were consecutive. Born in Pierrefonds, Quebec, Canada (a former
        city now part of the Montreal borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro), to French
        parents, the family soon relocated to Chaville, near Paris, where Farmer
        pursued a career in modelling and acting. She later gained prominence as
        a recording artist with the release of her debut single "Maman a tort"
        in 1984. In 1988, she released her second studio album, Ainsi soit
        je..., which sold 1.5 million copies in France. The album spawned
        Farmer's first number one on the French singles chart, "Pourvu qu'elles
        soient douces". Her third studio album, L'autre..., sold two million
        copies, becoming Farmer's best-selling album to date. Its lead single,
        "Désenchantée", became Farmer's most successful single, and is often
        described as her signature song. Departing from the synth-pop and
        Europop soundscape of her first albums, Farmer reinvented her musical
        style with the release of her fourth studio album, Anamorphosée, in
        1995. Recorded in the United States, the album features more live
        instrumentation and shows rock and R&B-oriented influences. Her fifth
        studio album, Innamoramento, was released in 1999, featuring more
        electronic influences. In the second part of the 2000s, Farmer continued
        exploring a range of genres on her albums, namely acoustic pop music on
        Avant que l'ombre... and electronica on Point de suture. In 2010, Farmer
        released her eighth studio album, Bleu noir. The album marked Farmer's
        return to the dark synth-pop and Europop production of her first albums.
        The lead single, "Oui mais... non", sold over 130,000 copies in France.
        In 2015, Farmer's tenth studio album, Interstellaires, debuted at number
        one in France; the album was preceded by the lead single "Stolen Car", a
        duet with Sting, which reached the number one position on the French
        singles chart in September 2015. Her eleventh studio album,
        Désobéissance, was released in 2018, debuting at number one and selling
        over 265.000 copies. In addition to her music career, Farmer also worked
        as a lyricist for French singer Alizée, while also being responsible for
        her image and public appearances. Her debut single, "Moi... Lolita",
        co-written by Farmer, reached number one in several countries in Europe,
        and peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart in February 2002.
        Farmer made her film debut in 1994, starring in Giorgino, and in 2018,
        she starred in the English-language horror film Ghostland. Throughout
        her career, Farmer has broken a number of records. She is the
        best-selling French singer since 1984, has a record number of diamond
        records, and she is the only artist to have obtained a diamond album in
        four consecutive decades. Selling over two million copies, her 2001
        greatest hits album Les Mots is the highest-selling compilation album by
        a French recording artist.

      <h4>Musical collaborations</h4>
      <p class="biography">
        Musically, Farmer is usually described as a pop and French pop artist,
        nevertheless, she is known for reinventing her style with every album
        cycle. All her albums between 1984 and 2008 were produced by her
        collaborator, Laurent Boutonnat. Her first albums, Cendres de lune,
        Ainsi soit je... and L'autre... feature dark synth-pop and new wave
        instrumentation. 1995 saw the release of Anamorphosée, which features
        more simplistic lyrics and pop rock-influenced music. Innamoramento and
        Avant que l'ombre... are often described as merging acoustic instruments
        with electronic beats. Farmer then experimented with electronica and
        club music on 2008's Point de suture. In 2010, Farmer released her first
        album without Laurent Boutonnat, Bleu noir, featuring songs produced by
        RedOne, Moby and British alternative band Archive. The album saw Farmer
        return to the darker synth-pop and Europop production of her debut
        album. For 2012's Monkey Me, Farmer collaborated with Boutonnat in the
        studio one more time. Interstellaires, the singer's tenth studio album
        shows influences of pop rock and adult contemporary styles, produced by
        French DJ The Avener and Martin Kierszenbaum. On Désobéissance, Farmer
        collaborated with French DJ Feder, American singer-songwriter LP and
        American producer Mike Del Rio, marking a return to electronic dance
        music. For L'Emprise, Farmer collaborated with Woodkid to produce a
        "confidant, and very intimate" album which offers a mix of symphonic
        music, industrial rhythms, and electropop. Moby, AaRON, and Archive also
        contributed to the album.

        "Buddhism is a bandage for the soul.",
        "Time belongs to no one, elusive ballet of stars, Present moment, you are the essence of the journey.",
        "It seems to me that fame should reflect the recognition of a work, of an action, by the public. Not a cult of personality. Today, we confuse popularity and fame. I prefer to continue moving forward for recognition of my work.",
        "I have always attached a fundamental importance to my independence. Over time, I realized how valuable it is to be able to decide for yourself. It is a feeling of absolute freedom. A chance too, of course. I am aware of it.",
        "The infinitely mysterious, the existence of a beyond... A poetic sky... The divine. But it is also the possibility of somewhere else for future generations. The sky is undoubtedly no longer synonymous with a purely spiritual journey, but in the future a possible conquest... Reality will perhaps join science fiction.",
        "Most of my choices are intuitive. Sometimes I need to be out of my comfort zone, to be carried by a feeling. It is exhilarating, it is nerve-wracking and that is life.",
        "I don't think it's pride or being sure of oneself. I think it is more of an aversion to compromise. I always told myself that I would never be ruled by my own fears. Because fears can lead to terrible things. But, I never gave in to my fears. I overcame my fears. Sometimes they come back with force, with a bang. But, I will never do anything that is driven by fear. Never.",
        "I like to develop the imagination, I like to fly away, I like to dream, I like to think. Yes, it is one of my favorite themes.",
        "I tried to express a certain flight, the idea of a shock caused by love, as falling in love can take you up or down.",
        "The artist must disappear behind his art. It seems to me that it is a duty of humility.",
        "The unpredictability appeals to me. This is what transforms everyday life into adventure and life into destiny.",
